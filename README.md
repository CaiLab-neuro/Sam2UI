# Gaze Target Annotator — Video Segmentation with SAM3 / SAM2

Gaze Target Annotator is part of the [GazeBehavior Annotation Toolkit (GBAT)](https://github.com/CaiLab-neuro/GazeBehaviorAnnotationToolkit).

It is a video object segmentation tool built on Meta's [SAM3](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam3) and [SAM2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2). It was originally designed for segmenting object instances in scene videos acquired from head-mounted eye-trackers in eye-tracking studies, but it is equally suitable as a general-purpose tool for video and image instance segmentation.

For eye-tracking research, it additionally maps gaze coordinates from the eye-tracker onto the segmented objects, producing a **time course of gaze targets** (which object the participant looks at, moment by moment).

## Key Advantages

- **Long-video support** — we have optimized GPU and CPU memory footprint to allow you to process long videos (we tested on 30,000+ frames, but it should work on even longer videos) on a machine with modest GPU (> 16 GB VRAM).
- **Fully local computing** — all models run on your own machine/server. No video ever goes to a third-party cloud unless you send by yourself, which matters for sensitive research recordings that contain faces of participants and others.
- **Friendly graphical interface** — annotate with text prompts, clicks, or boxes in a point-and-click UI; no coding required for the core workflow.
- **Gaze-target time course** — combine segmentation masks with eye-tracker gaze coordinates (Pupil Labs format) to label the gazed object for every gaze sample, with confidence scores and diagnostic figures.
- **Text-prompt detection (SAM3)** — describe objects in plain language ("person", "toy", "table") and detect every instance across the whole video automatically.
- **Interactive refinement** — correct any mistake with positive/negative clicks or boxes and run SAM3/2 again to refine segmentation; corrections from all rounds are preserved as feedback to the SAM model.
- **Headless batch processing** — as the processing time is long for long videos, the processing jobs can run on a remote GPU server, while you provide feedback or add annotation for the next video to process.
- **Resumable projects** — annotations, refinements, and masks are stored on disk in a project directory; you can stop and resume at any stage.

## Two Pipelines: SAM3 and SAM2

The toolkit contains two parallel pipelines that share the same installation and output conventions:

| | SAM3 pipeline (recommended) | SAM2 pipeline |
|---|---|---|
| Prompting | Text prompt per concept (+ click/box refinement) | Click points per object |
| Detection | Finds **all** instances of a concept automatically | You annotate each object yourself in a few frames |
| UI | `sam3_ui.py` | `sam2_ui.py` |
| Batch CLI | `sam3_process.py` | `sam2_process.py` |
| Guide | **[SAM3 Guide](docs/sam3_guide.md)** | **[SAM2 Guide](docs/sam2_guide.md)** |

**SAM3 is likely the pipeline you want to start with.** The SAM2 pipeline remains useful in two situations:

1. **Concepts that are hard to prompt by text** — if SAM3 cannot reliably detect an object from a text description, a few manual clicks in the SAM2 UI can segment it directly.
2. **Many instances, few of interest** — SAM3 tracks *every* instance of a concept, which may increase GPU memory usage and processing time when a scene contains many (e.g., hundreds of toys) but you only need a few. With SAM2 you can click only the instances you care about.

The two pipelines interoperate: SAM3 results can be **exported into the SAM2 workflow** (`sam3_process.py --export-sam2`), so you can let SAM3 handle the easy concepts and pick up the remainder with SAM2 point annotation — without re-segmenting what SAM3 already covered. See the [SAM3 guide](docs/sam3_guide.md#exporting-to-the-sam2-pipeline) for details. SAM2-to-SAM3 porting is not yet supported.

After segmentation (from either pipeline), the **[Gaze-Target Alignment guide](docs/gaze_alignment.md)** describes how to generate the gaze-target time course from the masks and eye-tracker data.

## Installation

**IMPORTANT**: Before running setup, create and activate a dedicated conda environment or virtualenv.

```bash
# Recommended: conda environment with Python 3.12 (SAM3 requires 3.12+; SAM2 alone needs 3.10+)
conda create -n sam python=3.12 -y
conda activate sam

# Run the installer
python install.py
```

The installer:
- Checks the Python version (3.10+ for SAM2, 3.12+ for SAM3)
- Installs Python dependencies (torch, opencv, numpy, ...)
- Clones and installs **SAM2** into `sam_models/sam2/` with interactive checkpoint selection
- Optionally clones and installs **SAM3** into `sam_models/sam3/` (requires PyTorch 2.7+, CUDA 12.6+, and HuggingFace access approval — see the [SAM3 guide](docs/sam3_guide.md#installation))
- Creates launcher scripts (`run.sh` / `run.bat`) and verifies the installation
- SAM3 checkpoint needs to be downloaded by yourself as it requires approval from Huggingface.

Alternative with venv:

```bash
python3 -m venv sam_env
source sam_env/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
# sam_env\Scripts\activate    # Windows
python install.py
```

### Troubleshooting Setup

- **Python version**: requires 3.10+ for SAM2, 3.12+ for SAM3 (`python --version`)
- **Git not installed**: download from https://git-scm.com/downloads
- **Failed to install some packages**: try downgrading Python from the newest version, then rerun `install.py`. If it still fails, install the failed package with conda or pip, then rerun `install.py`. You can report to us such cases in github issue.
- **Failed to load pytorch_python dll**: remove torch and torchvision, then let `install.py` reinstall them
- **Model not found at runtime**: run `install.py` again and download the missing checkpoint

## Staying Up to Date
